# College_Admission

* Utilized Postgres SQL for querying and manipulating data from the college admission database, with the focus on the California Universities. 
* Used R to render graphs to visualize the results to the following investigative questions:

1. With areas (county and city) held constant, is it easier to be admitted to California
universities through transfer from a college or direct admission from high school?
2. Is geographical location independent of admission rate for high school? In other words,
do all high schools from one location yield a high admission rate, and other high schools
from another location yield a low admission rate?
3. Is ethnicity a factor in high school and college transfer admission rates?
